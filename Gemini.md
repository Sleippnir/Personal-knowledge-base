Based on your detailed answers, here is a recommended Information Architecture plan. It's designed to be robust, catering to your high friction tolerance and interest in automation, while prioritizing fast retrieval.

The ideal IA for you is a **Resource-First P.A.R.A. system** combined with a powerful **metadata header** for prioritization and filtering. This structure supports your preference for Browse logical folders, while the metadata creates a highly effective search and sorting capability.

### ## The Recommended Folder Structure

Your priority is `Resource > Area > Project`, so we will build the P.A.R.A. structure to reflect that. The numbers are for sorting, but the emphasis is on where you spend your time.

```
/PKM/
â”œâ”€â”€ 00_Inbox/
â”‚   # Everything new lands here first. Raw links, quick notes, etc.
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 01_Projects/
â”‚   # Goal-oriented work with a deadline.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Project_Q4_Report/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Project_MCP_Learning_Sprint/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 02_Areas/
â”‚   # Ongoing responsibilities and standards.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Area_Work_Performance/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Area_Professional_Development/
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ 03_Resources/
    # The heart of your system. A library of topics.
    â”œâ”€â”€ Resources_AI-ML/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Resources_Software_Development/
    â””â”€â”€ Resources_Cybersecurity/
```

### ## The Core of Your System: Metadata Headers

For every file you process, you will add a small block of YAML text at the very top. This "frontmatter" is the key to your priority and filtering needs and is natively understood by tools like Obsidian.

Here is a template. Place this at the top of every new markdown file you create or process:

YAML

```
---
status: triage
priority: P3
type: 
tags: []
source: ""
---
```

**How to Use It:**

- **`status`**: The current state of the note.
    
    - `triage`: Newly added, needs to be processed.
        
    - `learning`: An active topic you are currently studying.
        
    - `active-tool`: A tool or reference you use regularly (like the Excalidraw link).
        
    - `archived`: Good information, but not in active use.
        
- **`priority`**: Your requested hierarchy system.
    
    - `P1`: Critical, top of mind.
        
    - `P2`: Important, to be reviewed soon.
        
    - `P3`: Medium importance, general knowledge.
        
    - `P4`: Low priority.
        
- **`type`**: The "food group" of the information.
    
    - `paper`, `tutorial`, `website`, `course`, `repo`, `cheatsheet`, `SOP`
        
- **`tags`**: Keywords for searching.
    
    - `[python, visualization, matplotlib]`
        
- **`source`**: The original URL, for reference.

### ## The "Gardening" Workflow ðŸª´

Given your interest in automation, here is a two-phased approach to maintaining your system.

#### Phase 1: The Manual Weekly Review

First, you must perform the task manually to understand the logic. Schedule 30 minutes once a week to:

1. Go to your `00_Inbox` folder.
    
2. For each item, open the file.
    
3. Read or skim the content.
    
4. **Fill out the metadata frontmatter**: Assign a `status`, `priority`, `type`, and add `tags`.
    
5. **Move the file** to its permanent home in `01_Projects`, `02_Areas`, or `03_Resources`.
    

#### Phase 2: The Future "LLM Gardener" Project ðŸ¤–

Once you are comfortable with the manual workflow, you can automate it. This becomes a **Project** in your system.

**The Goal**: Create a script (e.g., in Python) that can process your inbox for you.

**The Logic**:

1. The script lists all files in the `00_Inbox`.
    
2. For each file, it reads the content and prepares a prompt for an LLM.
    
3. **The Prompt**: _"You are an expert librarian. Analyze the following content and generate a YAML frontmatter block. The content is about `[content of the note]`. Assign a `status`, `priority` (P1-P4), `type`, and a list of relevant `tags`. Finally, suggest the best destination folder from this list: `[list of your resource/area folders]`. Your output must be only the YAML block and the folder path."_
    
4. The script executes the prompt, receives the structured output from the LLM, inserts the YAML frontmatter at the top of the file, and moves the file to the suggested folder.
    

### Proposed File Naming Standard

The proposed structure is: `Topic-or-Project_Descriptor.md`

- **`Topic-or-Project`**: The main subject. This should be concise and match the folder it's likely to live in. This directly supports your browse-first instinct.
    
    - _Examples:_ `MCPs`, `Python-Pandas`, `Q4-Report`
        
- **`Descriptor`**: A short, descriptive keyword about the note's content.
    
    - _Examples:_ `Course-Notes`, `Cheatsheet`, `Meeting-Minutes`, `Tool-Link`
        

#### Examples in Practice:

- For your MCP learning notes: `MCPs_Huggingface-Course-Notes.md`
    
- For the Excalidraw link: `Excalidraw_Collaborative-Tool-Link.md`
    
- For a new cheatsheet: `Python_Data-Visualization-Cheatsheet.md`
    

### The Role of Dates

You'll notice the date is not a primary part of this naming convention. This is intentional. The date a note was created is metadata. Forcing it into the filename can be cumbersome.

However, if you have multiple notes on the exact same topic and descriptor, adding a date can be a simple way to differentiate them:

- `Q4-Report_Meeting-Minutes_2025-08-07.md`
    
- `Q4-Report_Meeting-Minutes_2025-08-14.md`
    

### Flexibility is Key

This standard is a guideline, not a rigid rule. The goal is utility, not adherence for its own sake.

- If a note is simple and unique, a simple name is best. The file for the Excalidraw link could just be `Excalidraw.md`.
    
- You can adapt the structure as needed. The most important thing is consistency _within a specific context_. All your meeting notes for a project should follow the same pattern.
    

By following this approach, your folder structure will be easy to browse, and the metadata will enable the powerful, priority-based searching you require.

Of course. Here are the clear, systematic guidelines for processing files from your `00_Inbox`. I will follow this protocol when operating as your "LLM Gardener."

---

### **Protocol: Inbox Processing and File Triage**

**Objective:** To systematically process new items from the `00_Inbox`, assign accurate metadata, and file them in the correct destination folder, flagging any ambiguities for your review.

#### **1. YAML Frontmatter Assignment**

For each file, I will analyze the content to determine the value for each field as follows:

- **`status`**:
    
    - **`active-tool`**: Assigned if the content is primarily a link to or description of a tool, software, or immediately usable online utility (e.g., a link to Excalidraw, a color-picker website).
        
    - **`learning`**: Assigned if the content is a tutorial, online course, research paper, or book that requires dedicated time to study and absorb.
        
    - **`archived`**: Assigned if the content is a reference, completed meeting notes, or background information that does not require immediate action or study but is valuable for future retrieval.
        
    - **`triage`**: This is the default status for any new item. It will remain if the final categorization is ambiguous.
        
- **`priority`**:
    
    - **`P1` (Critical)**: Assigned if the content contains explicit keywords like "urgent," "deadline," "critical," or is directly related to a known, active `P1` project.
        
    - **`P2` (High)**: Assigned to content related to core professional responsibilities, important but not urgent tasks, or topics you have explicitly defined as a current focus.
        
    - **`P3` (Medium)**: This is the default priority for general knowledge, resources, tutorials, and interesting articles that are for future learning.
        
    - **`P4` (Low)**: Assigned to non-essential updates, interesting but tangential links, or items for long-term, "someday/maybe" review.
        
- **`type`**:
    
    - I will determine the type by scanning for structural clues:
        
    - **`repo`**: If a `github.com`, `gitlab.com`, etc., link is the primary content.
        
    - **`paper`**: If the document includes an "Abstract," "Introduction," "Conclusion," or citations.
        
    - **`tutorial`**: If the content includes "step-by-step," "how-to," "guide," or is structured as a sequence of instructions.
        
    - **`cheatsheet` or `SOP`**: If the content is a dense list of commands, functions, or procedural steps.
        
    - **`course`**: If it links to a learning platform (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, Hugging Face Courses) or describes a curriculum.
        
    - **`website`**: If it is a link to a general-purpose website or tool.
        
- **`tags`**:
    
    - I will generate a list of 3-5 tags by extracting key technologies (`Python`, `Docker`, `Obsidian`), concepts (`information-architecture`, `machine-learning`), and proper nouns from the text. I will normalize them to lowercase and use hyphens for multi-word tags.
        
- **`source`**:
    
    - If the file content is derived from a web page, the primary URL **must** be placed in this field. If the note is original thought, this field will be left empty.
        

#### **2. Destination Folder Selection Criteria**

I will use the following logic to determine the destination, in order of precedence:

1. **`01_Projects`**:
    
    - **Criteria**: The content is directly and explicitly required to achieve a **specific, time-bound goal with a defined outcome**.
        
    - **Indicators**: The content mentions a known project name, a specific deadline, or phrases like "project plan," "sprint tasks," "Q3 report requirements."
        
2. **`02_Areas`**:
    
    - **Criteria**: The content relates to an **ongoing standard of performance or a long-term responsibility** in your life or work. It does not have a specific end date.
        
    - **Indicators**: Keywords like "professional development," "performance review," "weekly planning," "personal finance," "health and fitness."
        
3. **`03_Resources`**:
    
    - **Criteria**: This is the **default destination** for any content saved for its topic value. If the information is not tied to a specific project or ongoing area of responsibility, it is a resource.
        
    - **Indicators**: Tutorials, papers, articles, and general notes on topics of interest (e.g., notes on a new programming language, an article about history, a collection of design patterns).
        

#### **3. Handling Ambiguity and Exceptions**

If a file cannot be categorized with high confidence according to the rules above, I will follow this strict protocol:

1. **Do Not Move**: The file will remain in the `00_Inbox`.
    
2. **Assign Status `triage`**: The `status` field in the frontmatter will be set to `triage`.
    
3. **Assign `#needs-review` Tag**: I will add the tag `#needs-review` to the `tags` list.
    
4. **Add a Note (Optional)**: If applicable, I will add a comment at the bottom of the file explaining the ambiguity (e.g., ``).
    

These guidelines will ensure your system remains organized, predictable, and aligned with the architecture we have designed.
